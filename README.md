# Git-testing
Nothing major, Just getting my hands into git & github, and pushing existing repo from cli
## To get the cli command to use on terminal
`Create a new repo(don't tick the 'CREATE README" option) on GitHub`

```
1. git remote add origin <repo URL ie https://github.com/blahblah.git>
2. git branch -M main
3. git push -u origin main
```
